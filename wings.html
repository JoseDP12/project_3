  <h1>Chicken Wings</h1>
  <section>
    <h2>The Flavors</h2>
	  <p>Like many, I LOVE food and I can say with 100% confidence that a fried chicken wing tossed in sauce has to one of my favorites to enjoy on any given day. The versatlity of chicken wings is what I enjoy the most, wether its a buffalo hot sauce or a swwet bbq flavor. The fact that I can have 20 different types of flavors grants me 20 different expeirences with the wings. Hands down garlic parmeasan is my favorite flavor when it comes to any wing. With that garlic aroma and a cheesy aftertaste, nine out of ten times if its an option I am choosing a garlic parm wing.</p>

    <h2>The Vibes</h2>
      <p>Any thing I love about wings is that they're the perfect food when watching a sporting event! Something I enjoy doing quite frankly so you can see how they go hand and hand. They're also considered an appetizer in many resturants but there is also fast food chains deddicated to serving chicken wings, touching again on how versatile they can be. Depending on their size, ordering 50-100 wings can easily serve a group of four people. It's the perfect option when having friends over and with various flavors you can satsify all parties.</p>
